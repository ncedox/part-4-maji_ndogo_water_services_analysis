# Maji Ndogo Water Services Analysis
## Overview

This project analyzes water access and infrastructure in the Maji Ndogo region. Its purpose is to identify critical water service issues, prioritize repairs, and provide actionable guidance for decision-makers and field teams.
## Key Problems Identified
### 1. Broken taps at home
Many towns have a significant portion of installed home taps that are non-functional. This causes inconvenience and forces citizens to rely on shared or unsafe water sources.
### 2. Contaminated wells
Wells are sometimes chemically or biologically contaminated, creating health risks for communities that rely on them.
### 3. Long queues at shared taps
In towns with high populations and insufficient shared taps, wait times often exceed 30 minutes, leading to inefficiency and poor water access.
### 4.Reliance on rivers
Some communities depend on river water, which is often unsafe and requires immediate intervention through drilling wells or alternative water sources.
### 5. Unequal infrastructure distribution
Some towns and provinces (e.g., Dahabu) have well-functioning infrastructure, while others (e.g., Amanzi, Amina) are hotspots with almost entirely broken systems. This indicates unequal resource allocation.
# Major Findings

### 1.Provincial Water Source Distribution
Shared taps are the most common water source across all provinces.
Broken home taps are a major issue in Amanzi and Hawassa.
Wells are significant in Hawassa and Akatsi, while rivers are less commonly used.
### 2.Town-Level Insights
Rural towns dominate in population, making them high-impact areas for repair interventions.
Several towns have substantial home-tap infrastructure but high broken-tap percentages, showing existing systems are failing.
Dahabu is an exception, with fully functional home taps, serving as a model for good infrastructure.
### 3.Broken Tap Prioritization
Amanzi, Amina: 95% of home taps broken — highest priority.
Kilimani, Zuri: 65% broken taps.
Hawassa, Amina: 56% broken taps.
Other towns show broken tap percentages ranging from 23–55%, signaling widespread infrastructure issues.
### 4.Queue Time Analysis
Long queues are concentrated at shared taps in high-population areas.
Queue times over 30 minutes indicate a need for additional taps or temporary water delivery.
### 5. Water Source Interventions
Wells: Install RO filters for chemical contamination, UV + RO for biological contamination.
Rivers: Drill new wells to provide safe alternatives.
Shared taps: Add taps for every 30 minutes of average queue time.
Broken home taps: Diagnose and repair local infrastructure.
# Recommendations for Action
### 1.Prioritize repairs based on population impact and severity
Focus on towns with large populations and high broken tap percentages (e.g., Amanzi, Amina).
### 2.Target water quality improvements
Address contaminated wells immediately to prevent health risks.
### 3.Optimize shared taps
Install additional taps where queues are long, and deploy temporary water delivery solutions as needed.
## 4.Repair existing infrastructure first
Fix broken home taps before installing new ones to maximize efficiency and improve water access quickly.
## 5.Track progress systematically
Use a project tracking system (like Project_progress) to monitor repairs, completion status, and updates from field engineers.
# Impact
Improved water access for the largest number of people.
Reduced wait times at shared taps.
Healthier communities by addressing contaminated water sources.
Data-driven prioritization ensures resources go where they are needed most
